## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Seasonal Pattern**: Clear summer peaks (~30–40°C) and winter lows (~−10°C) across years.
- **Temp Distribution**: Most temps fall between 0°C and 20°C.
- **Humidity**: Strong negative correlation with temperature (−0.63).
- **Visibility**: Moderately positively correlated with temperature (+0.39).
- **Monthly Trends**: July & August are warmest; January & December coldest.
- **Wind**: Most wind speeds range 5–15 km/h.
- **Weather Types**: Cloudy conditions are most common.
- **Rain vs Snow**: Rain occurs at higher temps, snow at freezing levels.
